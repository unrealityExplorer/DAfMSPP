## petproject

This is my first attempt to develop and upload my own project here.
There were two main goals of creating this mini-application:

1) To consolidate in my memory what I've learned so far, of how to develop applications with R language using Shiny framework, by practice and by trying to implement various functionality.

2) To give medical students without mathematical background a simple and beginner-friendly tool for doing data exploration and data analysis with some statistical techniques, for their research tasks. There is automatic output from the uploaded/chosen data in forms of: charts, calculations results and tables.

Some functionality may be added or reworked later. The objectives of overall app design for end-users are: to simplify EDA and to minimize probability of making an error with improper use of statistical techniques.
